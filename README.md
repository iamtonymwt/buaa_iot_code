# BUAA IOT 

This is the course project for BUAA IoT course 2021

The system is named **Fire Warning System**

​	when the tensor_end on chip 'feels' the temperature & humidity are going wrong, it will send its infos to server_end and the server_end will tell the chips to Alarm (flicker, vibration).

​	people could also use the website to adjust the threshold value and check the history infos saved in database

Structure:


* Sensor_end is the code on chips
* Server_end is the code for server in django
* Front_end is the code for website
* Report in chinese
